## High-Impact Image Prompts

### 1. The Project "Hero" Image (Futuristic Agriculture)
> **Prompt:** A premium, ultra-modern 3D isometric landscape of a digital farm. A glass-walled control center sits in the middle of vibrant green crop fields. Holographic AI nodes connect individual plants to a floating dashboard. Warm sunset lighting, bokeh background, 8k resolution, cinematic lighting, 'KrishiSaarthi' aesthetic.

### 2. AI Crop Doctor (Diagnostic Tech)
> **Prompt:** Macro extreme close-up of a farmer holding a smartphone over a leaf with yellow spots. A digital translucent "scanning" beam is projecting from the screen onto the leaf. Floating icons of chemical structures and 'Healthy/Sick' status bars. High-tech agricultural photography style, sharp focus, vibrant greens.

### 3. Business Advisor (Smart Planning)
> **Prompt:** A friendly, helpful 3D character (Village Advisor) and a farmer standing in front of a giant holographic map of a farm. The map shows different sections for 'Beekeeping', 'Organic Veg', and 'Mushrooms'. Floating digital currency symbols and profit charts. Soft, bright, 3D Pixar-style render.

### 4. Green Credit Marketplace (Blockchain)
> **Prompt:** A semi-abstract isometric view of a digital marketplace. Each stall in the market has a glowing green plant icon and is connected by shimmering blockchain links. Data streams are flowing from a farm into a digital vault. Clean, minimalist, corporate-tech aesthetic, teal and leaf-green color palette.

## Pro-Tips for PPT Visuals
- **Consistency:** Use the same style (e.g., "3D Isometric" or "Cinematic Realistic") for all your images to make the presentation look cohesive.
- **Glassmorphism:** Use keywords like "glassmorphism", "frosted glass", and "soft translucency" to get that premium, modern web-app feel.
- **Color Palette:** Mention "leaf green, deep teal, and warm gold" in prompts to match KrishiSaarthi’s likely theme.
