## The "End-to-End Journey" AI Prompt

Copy and paste this into **Eraser.io** or **ChatGPT**:

> **Prompt:** "Create a user workflow diagram for KrishiSaarthi. The journey should follow these 6 phases:
> 
> 1. **Onboarding:** Farmer signs up -> role selection -> profile setup (region, budget, land).
> 2. **AI Diagnosis:** Farmer notices crop issue -> uploads photo -> AI identifies disease -> provides cure & pesticide advice.
> 3. **Smart Planning:** Farmer enters 'Business Advisor' -> AI analyzes profile -> suggests 3 profitable business ideas with ROI analysis.
> 4. **Sustainable Action:** Farmer adopts organic/water-saving practices -> collects photo/GPS evidence.
> 5. **Validation:** Validator reviews evidence on dashboard -> performs digital/physical check -> Approves claim.
> 6. **Value Exchange:** Blockchain mints Green Credit Tokens -> Farmer lists credits in Marketplace -> Buyer purchases credits with ETH/Tokens.
> 
> **Style:** Use a linear horizontal flow or a circular 'Loop' to show the continuous cycle of farming improvement. Use icons for 'Smartphone', 'AI Brain', 'Shield', and 'Blockchain Token'. Colors: Earthy tones (Brown, Green, Sun-Yellow)."
